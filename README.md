# Generating Bach's Last fugue

---

This repository contains code to predict Bach's last fugue using machine learning

The Simple Bigram folder contains the baseline bigram model. Run `simple_bigram.py` to generate music using bigram model. The `txt_to_midi.py` converts pitch text file to .midi file. You can listen to the generated output by playing `bigram_output.mid`.

The preprocessing folder contains converters to convert midi files to pitch list and pitch list back to midi. It also has a converter for converting midi files to characters and can convert text back to midi. The `DataScraping.ipynb` script downloads midi files from a particular website. `CharNN.ipynb` is the character level implementation of LSTM which trains on text characters converted from midi file.

If you want the trained embedding vectors you can get them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3WbMZCvxr_OeTqtFZiuXrGYJqrGExqv/view?usp=sharing).

The predicted outputs are available in the Generated Music folder.
